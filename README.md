# flowlist
A read it sooner list populated by your friends

## Problem 

* I asked my friend Morton if he saw that video i sent him the other day. He said that he saw the link but he didn't got around to watching it and now it's lost in the long chat conversation.

* Unlike Morton i have an app where I save content my friends shared with me so I can take care of it later. However, this app doesn't do much in helping me going through the content. In particular when I have videos to see, music to listen to and articles to read there is never really any flow to it as everything is mixed up in my list.

## Introducing Flowlist

How does Flowlist solve these two problems?

* As your friends can share content directly to your Flowlist, you don't have do add it to the list yourself. You can share content with any person in your contacts who also has Flowlist.

* Flowlist will label your content as either something to _watch_, _hear_ or _read_. Watching videos requires a different effort than reading articles for example, so it will be easy to go through whatever your mind is up to. Content is automatically labeled depending on the URL of the contnet, with the ability for the sharing user to override the suggested label. 


## Features

* **Auto-archive** will put content you haven't gotten around to in an archive on a regular weekly basis. This prevents the list from [stacking up with content you will never get around to](https://zenhabits.net/simple-rules/).

* **Archive-on-open** archives the content directly when you open the content, so you won't have to go back and clear the list of the items you've taken care of.

* **Time** is displayed for each item on your list, so you can see how long it will take to watch the video, listen to music or even read the articles. So you can tick of those items that can be done before the bus arrives. 

* **Back-to-back playback** will be available for (YouTube) videos. So you can watch all the videos with just one click then sit back and relax.
